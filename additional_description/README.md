# Asyns in JS

    * single-codestreaming and multiple-codestreamimg
        - Javascript is a single-codestream. There is no possibility to make a JavaScript a multiple-codestreaming
        - Asyns code in JS in made by using Code Planning. For example do the code after min. 2 sec, but it always means, that this 2 sec is a minimun time, because the code is putted on waiting queue, and will be made after ALL SYNCHONE CODE WILL BE DONE.
        - For making separate stream is necessary to use browser tool -> web workers | service workers | worklets -> [https://bitsofco.de/web-workers-vs-service-workers-vs-worklets]

    * Planning setTimeout() | setInterval()
        - Bootstrap Styles -> [https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.1/getting-started/introduction/] for modals (setTimeout)

    * Date and Time 
        - Date library [https://date-fns.org/]
        - It is hard to serve date and time in JS
